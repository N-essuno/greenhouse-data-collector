# Sirius Greenhouse - InfluxDB client

This is a client library for InfluxDB. It is used to send data obtained from the sensors of a greenhouse to a Database in InfluxDB.

The script should run on a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to the sensors and the InfluxDB server.

The sensors retrieve data related to:

- Light intensity of the greenhouse (in lux)
- Temperature of a shelf in the greenhouse (in Â°C)
- Moisture level of a pot in the greenhouse (in %)
- Quantity of water pumped from the water tanks (in liters)

## Configuration

Modify the [config.ini.example](config.ini.example) file to set the URL of the InfluxDB server, the personal access token and the organization ID. Save the file as `config.ini`.
For other optional parameters, see the [documentation](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python).

You can set the raw voltages reading of the sensors so they can be converted to meaningful values. The array can be of arbitrary length and will be mapped to a range of 0 to 100 <!-- FIXME: update if changes happen in the range -->

## Installation

## Testing

To load dummy data on your local influxdb database, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python src/load_dummy_data_smol.py
```
