# Data Collector python script

The scripts in this project are used to collect data from the sensors of a Greenhouse and send them to an InfluxDB instance.

The script should run on Raspberry Pi devices (**Data Collectors**), which are physically connected to the sensors and virtually connected to the InfluxDB server.

The sensors retrieve data related to:

- **Light** intensity of the **greenhouse** (in lux)
- **Temperature** of the **shelves** in the greenhouse (in Â°C)
- **Humidity** of the **shelves** in the greenhouse (in %)
- **Moisture** level of the **pots** in the greenhouse (in %)
- **Health** of the **plants** in the greenhouse (in %)
- **Growth** of the **plants** in the greenhouse (in %)
- Quantity of **water pumped** from the **water tanks** (in liters)

## Configuration

Modify the [config.ini.example](src/config.ini.example) file to set the URL of the InfluxDB server, the personal access token and the organization ID. Save the file as `config.ini`.
For other optional parameters, see the [documentation](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python).

You can set the raw voltages reading of the sensors, so they can be converted to meaningful values. The array can be of arbitrary length and will be mapped to a range of 0 to 100 <!-- FIXME: update if changes happen in the range -->

## Installation

## Testing

To load dummy data on your local influxdb database, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python src/load_dummy_data_smol.py
```
